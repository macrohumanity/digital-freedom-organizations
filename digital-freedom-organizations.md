# Digital Freedom Organizations #

---------------------------------

## Electronic Freedom Foundation ##
"The Electronic Frontier Foundation is the leading nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world.

EFF's mission is to ensure that technology supports freedom, justice, and innovation for all people of the world."

## Free Software Foundation ##
"As our society grows more dependent on computers, the software we run is of critical importance to securing the future of a free society. Free software is about having control over the technology we use in our homes, schools and businesses, where computers work for our individual and communal benefit, not for proprietary software companies or governments who might seek to restrict and monitor us. The Free Software Foundation exclusively uses free software to perform its work.
The Free Software Foundation is working to secure freedom for computer users by promoting the development and use of free (as in freedom) software and documentation—particularly the GNU operating system—and by campaigning against threats to computer user freedom like Digital Restrictions Management (DRM) and software patents.”

## Privacy International ##
“Governments and corporations are using technology to exploit us. Their abuses of power threaten our freedoms and the very things that make us human. That’s why PI is here: to protect democracy, defend people's dignity, and demand accountability from institutions who breach public trust.”

## American Civil Liberties Union ##
“The ACLU has evolved in the years since from this small group of idealists into the nation’s premier defender of the rights enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. With more than 1.5 million members, nearly 300 staff attorneys, thousands of volunteer attorneys, and offices throughout the nation, the ACLU of today continues to fight government abuse and to vigorously defend individual freedoms including speech and religion, a woman’s right to choose, the right to due process, citizens’ rights to privacy and much more.“
